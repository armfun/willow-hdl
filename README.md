== About =============================================================

This folder contains partial Verilog source for the Willow
electrophysiology system.

Due to copyright concerns, the full HDL codebase for Willow is not
included here, and so this codebase as is will not build/work. In
particular, Willow runs a proprietary, closed-source SATA controller
core which we are unable to share. Replacing this with an open variant
is high on our to-do list; in the meantime, we sincerely apologize for
any inconvenience. If anyone would like to contribute or point us to
an open SATA controller for the Spartan-6 LX75T, or for any other
questions or inquiries, please contact neuro@leaflabs.com.
